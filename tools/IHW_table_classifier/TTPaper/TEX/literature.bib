  title = {The SIDER database of drugs and side effects},
  journal = {Nucleic Acids Research},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Unwanted side effects of drugs are a burden on patients and a severe
	impediment in the development of new drugs. At the same time, adverse
	drug reactions (ADRs) recorded during clinical trials are an important
	source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine
	data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture
	of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in
	which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created
	the SIDER (‘Side Effect Resource’, http://sideeffects.embl.de) database
	of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on
	1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug–ADR pairs, which is an increase
	of 40% compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses,
	we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the
	package inserts. This information is available for 39% of drug–ADR
	pairs, 19% of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo
	treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications,
	extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing.
	These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives
	by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs.},

Vocabularies integrated in the UMLS Metathesaurus include the NCBI taxonomy, Gene Ontology, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base. UMLS concepts are not only inter‐related, but may also be linked to external resources such as GenBank. In addition to data, the UMLS includes tools for customizing the Metathesaurus (MetamorphoSys), for generating lexical variants of concept names (lvg) and for extracting UMLS concepts from text (MetaMap). The UMLS knowledge sources are updated quarterly. All vocabularies are available at no fee for research purposes within an institution, but UMLS users are required to sign a license agreement. The UMLS knowledge sources are distributed on CD‐ROM and by FTP. }",

	abstract = "{Background: Risk-of-bias assessments are now a standard component of systematic reviews. At present, reviewers need to manually identify relevant parts of research articles for a set of methodological elements that affect the risk of bias, in order to make a risk-of-bias judgement for each of these elements. We investigate the use of text mining methods to automate risk-of-bias assessments in systematic reviews. We aim to identify relevant sentences within the text of included articles, to rank articles by risk of bias and to reduce the number of risk-of-bias assessments that the reviewers need to perform by hand. Methods: We use supervised machine learning to train two types of models, for each of the three risk-of-bias properties of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. The first model predicts whether a sentence in a research article contains relevant information. The second model predicts a risk-of-bias value for each research article. We use logistic regression, where each independent variable is the frequency of a word in a sentence or article, respectively. Results: We found that sentences can be successfully ranked by relevance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) \\&gt; 0.98. Articles can be ranked by risk of bias with AUC \\&gt; 0.72. We estimate that more than 33\\% of articles can be assessed by just one reviewer, where two reviewers are normally required. Conclusions: We show that text mining can be used to assist risk-of-bias assessments. }",
