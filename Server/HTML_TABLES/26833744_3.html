Liraglutide exposure and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c).Exposure expressed as model-derived area under the curve (AUC) at steady-state versus HbA1c change from baseline (A) in individuals with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes (Trial 2); (B) in individuals with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes, stratified by baseline HbA1c (Trial 2). Data are mean values (with 95% confidence interval) versus expo-sure expressed as six quantiles of AUC values (plus placebo). Sigmoidal curved lines represent covariate-adjusted model-based estimates for each trial population. Horizontal bars with diamonds represent median and 90% exposure ranges from each dose level.
