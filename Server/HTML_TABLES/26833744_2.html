<div class="headers"><div>Figure2. Liraglutide exposure and body weight loss in men and women.Liraglutide exposure expressed as model-derived area under the curve (AUC) at steady state versus body weight change from baseline (A) for men and women in Trials 1–3 combined (covariate adjusted values); (B) for men and women at the extremes of exposure. Body weight data are mean values (with 95% confidence intervals). Horizontal bars with cir-cles/squares/triangles represent median and 90% exposure ranges from each dose level (A), or from men and women at the extremes of expo-sure (B). Sigmoidal curved lines represent covariate-adjusted model-based estimates for defined populations. (A) Exposure expressed as six quantiles of AUC values (plus placebo). (B) Exposure and weight change for the placebo- or liraglutide-treated heaviest men and lightest women, as well as the overall cohort mean in Trial 1. Trial 1, SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes; Trial 2, SCALE Diabetes; Trial 3, the phase II trial.</div></div><table class='gmisc_table' style='border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;' >
